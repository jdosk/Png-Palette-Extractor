# Png-Palette-Extractor
This App is a simple palette extractor for easy creation of .pal files. Extracts the palette of an indexed .png file and writes to a .pal file. Files must be indexed, or will not write. You can index a png file in pretty much any image editing software.

How it Works:
1) Select a .png file
    - File MUST be indexed
2) App will read the .png and write the indexed palette to a .pal file in the correct file format
3) The .pal file will be saved to the same location as the .png
